# Exercise - Grading Program
''' 
You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the 
names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary 
called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of 
the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
